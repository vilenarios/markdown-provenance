# Markdown Provenance

A Claude Code slash command for uploading markdown files to Arweave permanent storage.

## Security Note

This command is **explicit invocation only**. It will NOT automatically trigger when you mention "arweave" or "permanent storage" in conversation. You must explicitly run `/markdown-provenance` to upload anything.

## Quick Start

1. Set up your Arweave wallet (see below)
2. Register with Claude Code (see below)
3. Run: `/markdown-provenance path/to/file.md`
4. Receive your permanent viewblock.io URL

## Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/markdown-provenance
npm install
```

## Wallet Setup

### Generate a New Wallet

```bash
npx -y arweave wallet generate > wallet.json
```

**IMPORTANT: Keep this file secure and never commit it to git!**

### Set Environment Variables

Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export MP_WALLET_PATH="/path/to/your/wallet.json"
export MP_AUTHOR="Your Name"  # Optional - adds Author tag to uploads
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

### Fund Your Wallet (for files >100KB)

Files under 100KB are **FREE** via Turbo.

For larger files, you need AR tokens:

1. Get your wallet address:
   ```bash
   npx arweave wallet address wallet.json
   ```

2. Purchase AR from an exchange (Binance, Gate.io, etc.)

3. Send AR to your wallet address

## Registering with Claude Code

To make `/markdown-provenance` available in Claude Code, you have several options:

### Option 1: Symlink to plugins directory (Recommended)

```bash
ln -s /path/to/markdown-provenance ~/.claude/plugins/markdown-provenance
```

### Option 2: Add to existing plugin

If you have an existing plugin, copy the `commands/` and `SKILL.md` to that plugin.

### Option 3: Reference in CLAUDE.md

Add to your global or project CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Available Commands

- `/markdown-provenance <file>` - Upload markdown to Arweave permanent storage
  Location: /path/to/markdown-provenance
```

## Usage

### Via Claude Code

```
/markdown-provenance ./my-document.md
```

### Via Command Line

```bash
cd /path/to/markdown-provenance
npm run upload ./my-document.md
```

Or directly:

```bash
npx tsx /path/to/markdown-provenance/scripts/upload-to-arweave.ts ./my-document.md
```

## Output

On success, you'll receive:

- **ViewBlock URL**: `https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/abc123...` (block explorer)
- **Direct Arweave URL**: `https://arweave.net/abc123...` (raw content)
- **IPFS CID**: Content identifier for the uploaded file

All transactions are logged to `~/.markdown-provenance/transactions.jsonl`

## Tags Applied

Each upload includes these metadata tags:

| Tag | Value |
|-----|-------|
| App-Name | Markdown Provenance |
| App-Version | 0.0.1 |
| Author | From `MP_AUTHOR` env var (if set) |
| IPFS-CID | Calculated from file content (CIDv1, SHA-256) |
| Content-Type | text/markdown |
| Type | Attestation |

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit wallet.json to version control**
- Store wallet in a secure location outside your project (e.g., `~/.arweave/wallet.json`)
- Back up wallet.json to multiple secure locations
- Consider using a hardware wallet for large holdings
- The `MP_WALLET_PATH` environment variable should point to this secure location

## Troubleshooting

### "MP_WALLET_PATH not set"

Set the environment variable pointing to your wallet.json file:

```bash
export MP_WALLET_PATH="/path/to/wallet.json"
```

### "Wallet file not found"

Check that the path in `MP_WALLET_PATH` is correct and the file exists:

```bash
ls -la $MP_WALLET_PATH
```

### "Insufficient funds"

Files over 100KB require AR tokens. Fund your wallet address with AR:

```bash
# Get your wallet address
npx arweave wallet address $MP_WALLET_PATH
```

### Network errors

Check your internet connection and retry. Arweave uploads may take a moment.

### "/markdown-provenance not found"

Make sure you've registered the skill with Claude Code (see "Registering with Claude Code" section above).

## Transaction Log

All uploads are logged to `~/.markdown-provenance/transactions.jsonl`:

```json
{"timestamp":"2025-01-15T12:00:00Z","file":"doc.md","txId":"abc...","url":"https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/abc...","cid":"bafkrei...","size":1234}
```

You can view your transaction history:

```bash
cat ~/.markdown-provenance/transactions.jsonl
```

Or get a count:

```bash
wc -l ~/.markdown-provenance/transactions.jsonl
```

## How It Works

1. **File Reading**: The script reads your markdown file
2. **CID Generation**: Calculates an IPFS-compatible CID (CIDv1, SHA-256, raw codec)
3. **Transaction Creation**: Creates an Arweave transaction with proper tags
4. **Upload**: Uses ArDrive Turbo SDK for reliable, fast uploads
5. **Logging**: Records the transaction in your local log file

## Acknowledgments

A huge thank you to the [ArDrive](https://ardrive.io) community for providing **free uploads for files under 100KB** through their Turbo SDK. This generous offering makes permanent, decentralized storage accessible to everyone and is what makes this tool practical for everyday use. Their commitment to lowering barriers to the permaweb is what enables projects like Markdown Provenance to exist.
